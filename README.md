Usage

Preprocessing

Load the dataset: The dataset should be loaded and split into training, validation, and test sets.

Data Augmentation: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data.

Training

Define the model: Create a CNN model using Keras.

Compile the model: Configure the model with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

Train the model: Train the model using the training data and validate it using the validation data.

Evaluation

Evaluate the model: Assess the model's performance on the test set.

Visualize results: Plot accuracy and loss curves, and visualize some predictions.

Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layers

Max-Pooling Layers

Fully Connected (Dense) Layers

Dropout Layers
